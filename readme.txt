This is an archived version of the table-based layouts for default Paid Memberships Pro pages, including the Checkout, Billing, and Confirmation pages.

== Description ==
In an effort to improve the display and responsive layout of default plugin pages, v1.9.4 of Paid Memberships Pro has migrated to a "table-free" layout for selected frontend pages. Users who had custom theme styling for updated pages can use this plugin as an interim solution while their theme author or developers update styles to match the new html formatting.

Affected pages include those pages using the following shortcodes: [pmpro_checkout], [pmpro_confirmation], and [pmpro_billing].

This plugin also loads the necessary portions of the Stripe and Braintree gateways to use a table-based method to draw the payment fields.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `pmpro-table-pages` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. That's it. No settings.
